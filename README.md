# Wesley Dufelmeier Data Analyst Portfolio

Hi, I'm Wesley. Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio! I have a background in Psychology and I'm passionate about transforming data into actionable insights. I'm currently working in the field of Data Analytics and have a strong interest in leveraging data storytelling to drive strategic decisions and create impactful visualizations. I strive to solve problem and collaborate with team members to generate value through data.

I've developed a solid understanding of data analysis, with a focus on using data to inform decisions. I also have a diploma from the General Assembly Data Analysis Bootcamp, where I gained practical experience in data wrangling, statistical analysis, and creating visual reports. This, combined with my training in Psychology, has helped me develop a keen understanding of human behavior and the ability to apply analytical techniques to real-world situations.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the intersection of data and media. I'm particularly drawn to fiction novels, comics, video games, and movies, where storytelling and data come together in unique ways. I'm constantly exploring new tools and techniques to improve my data analysis skills, and I'm always excited to learn more and tackle new challenges.
I’m looking forward to applying my skills to the world of data analytics, and I’m always open to new opportunities where I can continue to grow and contribute to meaningful projects.

My CV is available in PDF format, and you can also check out my personal repository to explore my projects, showcase my skills, and track my progress in Data Analytics.
